**Steganography**
Steganography in cybersecurity refers to the practice of hiding secret information within a non-secret message, image, or other medium in a way that makes it difficult to detect.

**Key Points**
1. Covert communication: Steganography allows for secret messages to be sent without arousing suspicion.
2. Data hiding: Steganography can be used to hide sensitive data within seemingly innocuous files or messages.
3. Security through obscurity: Steganography relies on the secrecy of the hidden message, rather than the security of the medium itself.

**Applications**
1. Secure communication: Steganography can be used to protect sensitive information from interception or eavesdropping.
2. Digital watermarking: Steganography can be used to embed hidden signatures or watermarks in digital media.
3. Malware detection evasion: Steganography can be used by attackers to hide malware or malicious code.
1. Statistical analysis
Steganalysis techniques can be used to detect hidden messages or anomalies in digital media.
2. Machine learning: AI-powered tools can be trained to detect steganographic patterns or anomalies.

ImportanceSteganography has both legitimate and malicious applications, making it an important area of study in cybersecurity.
